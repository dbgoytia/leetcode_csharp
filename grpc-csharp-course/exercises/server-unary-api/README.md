Exercise - Sum Unary API
==========================


Goal: In this exercise, the goal is to implement a sum RPC Unary API in a CalculatorService.

* The function takes a Request message that has two integers, and returns a Response that
represents the sum of them.

* Remember to first implement the service definition in a .proto file, alongside the RPC messages.

* Implement the Server code first.

* Test the server code by implementing the client.

Example:

1. The client will send two numbers (3 and 10), and the server will respond with (13).
